Cursor custom instructions for the UI

Branding and legal guardrails
	•	Do not use the brand name “Logitech” anywhere in UI text, page title, metadata, repo name, screenshots, or comments.
	•	Do not use any brand logos or product images.
	•	The design may be inspired by a premium hardware and tech aesthetic, but keep it generic.

Typography
	•	Font: Poppins for all UI text (headings and body).
	•	Headings: 600 weight.
	•	Body: 400 weight.
	•	Use short labels and simple English.

Color palette

Use these exact colors:
	•	Primary accent (Breakthrough Teal): #00FDCF
	•	Dark green (text or deep backgrounds): #0D3A32
	•	Light green (background tint): #D6F5F0
	•	Cream (page background): #F3F1EC
	•	Black: #1B1B1B
	•	Gray: #EEEEEE
	•	White: #FFFFFF

Rules:
	•	Background should be Cream or White, not dark.
	•	Use teal as accent only (buttons, highlights, progress).
	•	Avoid neon effects and heavy glow.

Layout and style
	•	Look and feel: clean, minimal, modern.
	•	Use generous spacing and whitespace.
	•	Rounded corners: 10–14 px.
	•	Soft shadow only (subtle).
	•	Use a single-column layout with a centered card for the upload flow.
	•	Keep the UI calm: no loud animations, no 3D visuals.

Components
	•	Main card: upload area + primary action.
	•	Secondary card: results summary + warnings.
	•	Results table: show table name, status, rows, cols, quality flag.
	•	Provide download buttons: cleaned Excel, combined CSV, JSON report.
	•	Warnings and errors must be explicit and easy to scan.

Copy rules
	•	No emojis by default.
	•	Use clear labels:
	•	“Upload spreadsheet”
	•	“Normalize”
	•	“Results”
	•	“Warnings”
	•	“Downloads”
	•	Explain normalization briefly in one paragraph max.

Gradients
	•	Allowed: very subtle gradient in header or accent bar:
	•	teal to light green
	•	Not allowed: strong gradients or multicolor gradients.

Implementation notes for Streamlit UI

If you build the MVP in Streamlit:

Theme file

Create .streamlit/config.toml with:---
Poppins font

Streamlit does not natively set Google Fonts everywhere, so inject CSS in the app:
	•	Load Poppins from Google Fonts
	•	Apply to body, buttons, inputs, tables
	•	Keep consistent spacing and radius
